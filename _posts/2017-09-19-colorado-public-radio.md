title: "Case Study: Digital Platforms @ CPR"
excerpt: Work for a National Public Radio member station.

For the past five years, I have managed the web presence for Colorado Public Radio, a public radio organization with stations for news, classical, and alternative music. 

As a web developer, I worked to improve [CPR's central website](http://www.cpr.org/) for both internal staff and the organization's audience. Built on Drupal 7 and boasting a complex asynchronous template system, the site focuses largely on persistent streaming of audio. We developed forward-thinking tools that made it simple for editors to upload produced audio, and for visitors to engage with stories.

Still, any organization's digital presence extends far beyond its website. As the Director of Digital platforms, I worked with an agency to build [a native app](http://www.cpr.org/listen/mobile) for iOS and Android, launched [five podcasts](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/organizations/32), standardized reporting with quarterly analytics reports, and managed a small team for social media and editorial decision-making. The combination of these efforts resulted in a doubling of digital audience during my tenure.
