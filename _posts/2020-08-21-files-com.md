[Files.com](https://www.files.com/) is a comprehensive file management platform designed for businesses. It boasts [an extensive and complex feature set](https://www.files.com/features/overview/), including integrations with APIs, remote servers, and granular permissioningâ€”all on top of the accoutrements you'd expect from a cloud storage solution like DropBox or Google Drive.

From 2017 through 2020, I led the UI/UX design of the React-powered Files.com web app and site. With over 350 commits to `master` under my belt and [dozens of Figma mockups](#linkToMockups), I touched most of our components and worked alongside the engineering team to bring high-quality product vision to production-ready code.

To document this highly complex codebase, I implemented a [Storybook-powered](https://storybook.js.org/) common component library that could be referenced by designers and developers alike. Here, our reusable presentational components could be toyed with and implemented with ease. Moreover, to ensure brand standards were followed throughout the organization, I crafted a style guide with critical resources for staff. All this was closely integrated with our onboarding process to ensure that every employee was empowered to use the Files.com brand.
